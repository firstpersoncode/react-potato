## FAQ
### How to enable & disable HTTP2?
Change the configuration on `/config/server.js`. Set `http2` to true of false.

### How to enable & disable ServiceWorker?
Change the configuration on `/config/service-worker.js`. Set `enable` to true of false.

### How to change the cache name on ServiceWorker?
We cannot really put it on config file, because `sw.js` file is not generated by webpack. So you need to manually edit the `sw.js` file located on `/public` folder and change the `CACHE_NAME` variable.
